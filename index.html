<section>

    <p>Hi, my name is Leslie Mollner. I first started working with code about 10 years ago while I was a college librarian. I had a lot of opportunities to work on the design, development, content, maintenance, and support for various areas of the college library's website as well as the website for the entire college.</p>

    <p>Through these <a href="#experience">work experiences</a>, and a variety of <a href="#education">education and training</a> experiences, I have developed a basic to intermediate level of skills and knowledge with HTML, CSS, content development, project management, UX and design. I would be very excited to have the chance to attend Prime Digital Academy so that I could be on a definitive and powerful path toward becoming a front end web/software developer.</p>

<section>

  <p>Did you guess that I like Star Wars?! Well, that was probably an easy one after you saw the Death Star image. Thought I'd throw that icon in there just for fun.</p>

  <p>Before I write a little more about myself, I wanted to mention that I am especially drawn to the group of traits you list on the Prime website when describing who should apply to your program. Words and phrases like resiliency, curiousity, resourcefulness, empathy, and inclusivity help me to understand a lot about the environment you strive to encourage at Prime. I believe I am a person who would thrive in this kind of environment.</p>

  <p>Besides coding, programming, and Star Wars there are many other things that are important to me. To further introduce myself, here are just a few additional parts of my life that bring me joy:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>My husband, Dan, and my two beagle girls, Georgie &amp; Peanut</li>
      <li>All the lovely members of my family as well as a great group of friends</li>
      <li>Sports, specifically gymnastics, diving, soccer, hockey, and swimming</li>
      <li>Art and creative projects, with an emphasis on my amateur status here in this realm</li>
      <li>Watching movies, listening to music, and learning about all sorts of topics, particularly history, politics, art, geography, and health</li>
      <li>Anything and everything related to Ancient Egypt and ancient history in general</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Here are a couple of additional ways to find me on social media. I have GitHub and CodePen accounts for future use as I progress through different paths and levels of learning. I hope to be able to build some useful, neat things on these sites soon. You'll also see a couple of other ways to get in touch with me.</p>
